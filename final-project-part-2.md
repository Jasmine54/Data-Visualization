## User Research 

### Goal of the Research

The primary goal of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of data visualization and storytelling in the web-based project "Saving Black Mothers: From Disparity to Action." The research aims to understand how well the data visualizations convey the story, the clarity of the narrative, the emotional and cognitive impact on the audience, and the overall user experience.

### Target Audience

- Public health officials and policymakers who can drive change.
- Healthcare professionals involved in maternal care.
- Members of the community, particularly those from demographics similar to the Black or African American population, who are impacted by this issue.
- Data scientists and public health students who are interested in the application of data visualization in storytelling.

### Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals
To select representative individuals for the interviews, I used a stratified sampling approach to ensure a diverse range of perspectives:

- Contacted public health departments and professional networks to connect with officials and healthcare providers.
- Reconnected with the community organizations where I interned last summer to find community health workers or health program coordinators.
- Reached out to Heinz College students and professors in the fields of data science and public health.

### Final Interviewee Information
|Interviewee Number| Gender | Age | Background |
|:--------------:|:----:|:-----:|-------------|
| Interviewee 1 | Female | 43 | Public health official
| Interviewee 2 | Female | 36 | Health program coordinator in a community with a high population of African American residents|
|Interviewee 3 | Male | 25 | Data science graduate student with a focus on public health policy|

### Interview Script (Basic Questions Included)

**Introduction**

- Were there any points where you felt lost or disconnected?

**Emotional and Cognitive Impact**
- Did the project make the importance of the issue clear to you? 
- Did the data presentation motivate you to take the next step?

**Areas for Improvement**
- Is there anything else you think could be improved in the data visualization or storytelling? 
- Do you have any suggestions for additional data or information that could be included?
- Any final thoughts or additional feedback?


### Interview findings

| Sections               | Interviewee 1 | Interviewee 2 | Interviewee 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Data Visualization Evaluation:**  Initial reaction | My initial reaction to the data visualizations was that they effectively highlighted the urgent need to reduce maternal mortality rates in the U.S., especially when compared to other developed countries. |My initial reaction was one of appreciation for the clarity and impact of the visualizations, as they effectively communicate the urgency of the issue and the disparities of the MMR among black women. |The project effectively highlighted the importance of the issue and the visualizations elicited a strong emotional response, emphasizing the urgency for action.|
| **Data Visualization Evaluation** Suggestions and Improvements  | While the visualizations were compelling, I suggest using only **the second bar graph for the US MMR comparison**, as it already includes all the necessary information from the first graph. For this graph, consider emphasizing the region of the US with wireframes or pointers to direct the audience's focus. Additionally, the labels (names of countries) on both graphs are too small for the audience to see. | Some graphs could be made more intuitive or utilize different forms to convey the message more clearly. For instance, for **the fourth graph showing the higher MMR among Black mothers compared with other races**, consider presenting the data in a line chart with an extended time range. This will effectively illustrate the persistent issue of higher MMR among Black mothers. For **the education graph**, you can use a line graph with different slopes to show that the improvement in education does not reduce the MMR of black women. This can help to demonstrate that the issue is systematic and not easily addressed through educational interventions. | I have several suggestions regarding the design of the visualizations. For **the first concept explanation graph**, it would be beneficial to use short bullet points to convey the ideas quickly, rather than providing a thorough explanation, in order to avoid clutter and ensure readability. Additionally, highlighting the region of only US MMR by race in **the second bar chart** would provide a quick and clear understanding for the audience. Lastly, for the **treemap**, enlarging the names of each cause would enhance visibility for the audience. |
| **Narrative Structure**| The flow of the story is logical and leads the reader through the issue in a structured manner. There were a few sections where I felt additional links between data points could provide a stronger narrative thread. For instance, the section on the causes of maternal mortality among Black mothers could be more closely connected to the subsequent section on preventable measures, illustrating how addressing these causes can directly impact reducing mortality rates. The call for action section could also be better linked to the data presented earlier (regarding preventable diseases for pregnancy, what can we do). The narrative would become more cohesive and impactful by directly connecting the proposed solutions to the specific issues highlighted in the data, providing a clearer pathway from problem to action.    |   The story flowed well overall, but there were moments where I felt a stronger connection between the data and the real-life experiences of the mothers could have been made. You can add some real cases in sections discussing the systemic factors or the causes of maternal mortality. For example, personal stories or testimonials from mothers who have faced challenges in accessing healthcare or who have experienced bias in the medical system could provide a more vivid and relatable illustration of the issues. This would not only enhance the emotional impact of the narrative but also help readers understand the human side of the data.          | Considering your target audience, it would be beneficial to segment them based on their backgrounds and influence and provide tailored suggestions to maximize the positive impact they can make in the 'call for action' section.|
| **Emotional and Cognitive Impact** |  The project does a good job of highlighting the significance of the issue. The visualizations stirred a sense of urgency in me, and the narrative reinforced my understanding of the systemic nature of these disparities.  |  The data presentation deepened my understanding of the issue and will inform my work moving forward. In the 'Can those causes be treated or prevented' part, it is crucial to provide more data and create clearer visualizations to demonstrate the impact of taking action. This can be a visualization of the total number of preventable deaths and the potential lives that could be saved if we take action. By doing so, you can evoke stronger emotions and garner support for subsequent actions.  | The data presentation deepened my understanding of the issue and will inform my future studies in data science and public health. |
| **Areas for Improvement**     |   I would also suggest a section that provides actionable steps for public health officials like myself. |  For improvement, I suggest including more real-life stories to make the data more relatable. Additionally, incorporating data on successful community-based interventions could provide valuable insights for practitioners like myself.         |   While the visualizations are compelling, integrating interactive elements could enhance user engagement. Additionally, incorporating data on successful interventions could provide valuable insights for practitioners and policymakers.         |


# Identified changes for Part III
-
-Data Visualizayion
For education
change the bar chart of education background to a line chart to show the change of MMR with the improvement of education background.
change the bar chart to compare the mothers death rate of less 
For cause
make the labels larger to make it more visible
