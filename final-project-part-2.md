## User Research 

### Goal of the Research

The primary goal of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of data visualization and storytelling in the web-based project "Saving Black Mothers: From Disparity to Action." The research aims to understand how well the data visualizations convey the story, the clarity of the narrative, the emotional and cognitive impact on the audience, and the overall user experience.

### Target Audience

- Public health officials and policymakers who can drive change.
- Healthcare professionals involved in maternal care.
- Members of the community, especially those from demographics similar to Black mothers, who are affected by this issue.
- Data scientists and public health students who are interested in the application of data visualization in storytelling.

### Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals
To select representative individuals for the interviews, I used a stratified sampling approach to ensure a diverse range of perspectives:

- Contact public health departments and professional networks to reach officials and healthcare providers.
- Partner with community organizations to connect with the community members.
- Reach out to Heinz College students and professers in data science and public health.

### Interview Script

**Introduction**
- Explain the purpose of the interview
- Assure confidentiality and consent for recording if necessary

**Background Questions**
- What is your familiarity with the topic of maternal mortality among Black mothers in America?
- How often do you interact with data visualizations related to public health issues?

**Data Visualization Evaluation**
- Show the web page designed with Shorthand.
- Ask the participant to navigate through the page silently and observe.
- What was your initial reaction to the data visualizations presented?
- Were there any visualizations that you found particularly compelling or confusing?
- How clear was the narrative accompanying the visualizations?

**Narrative Structure**
- How well did the story flow for you?
- Were there any points where you felt lost or disconnected?
- Was there a moment in the story that particularly resonated with you?

**Emotional and Cognitive Impact**
- Did the project make the importance of the issue clear to you? How did the visualizations make you feel about the subject matter?
- Did the data presentation change your understanding or perspective on the issue?

**Areas for Improvement**
- Is there anything you think could be improved in the data visualization or storytelling?
- Do you have any suggestions for additional data or information that could be included?

| Questions               | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Data Visualization Evaluation  |My initial reaction was one of appreciation for the clarity and impact of the visualizations. They effectively communicate the urgency of the issue. However, some graphs could use additional context to fully convey the complexities behind the data.  |||
| Narrative Structure | The flow of the story is logical and leads the reader through the issue in a structured manner. There were a few sections where I felt additional links between data points could provide a stronger narrative thread.     |             |             |

# Identified changes for Part III
-
-Data Visualizayion
For education
change the bar chart of education background to a line chart to show the change of MMR with the improvement of education background.
change the bar chart to compare the mothers death rate of less 
For cause
make the labels larger to make it more visible
