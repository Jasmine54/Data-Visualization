## Changes Made Since Part II

A detailed explanation of the changes I have made in each section, including any new additions.

### Section 1: What do we mean by Maternal Mortality Ratio?

**Narrative:**

In the first paragraph below the title, I began by quoting the World Health Organization's definition of Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) to provide the audience with a clear understanding of MMR. Following this, I will then compare MMR with the associated concept of maternal death during pregnancy to enhance the audience's comprehension.

**Visualization:**

For the first concept explanation image, I utilized short bullet points and larger word sizes to effectively convey the differences between the three concepts. This approach will prevent clutter and ensure readability for the audience.

### Section 2: How is the U.S. MMR?

**Visualization:**

- In the first bar chart, I increased the font size of the labels to improve visibility. Also, I relocated the country names from the x-axis to the y-axis and arranged them based on MMR from high to low to provide a more intuitive comparison, highlighting the high MMR of the United States at the top of the graph.

- For the second bar chart, I also enhanced the visibility of the labels by increasing their font sizes and relocating the country names and the overall layout of the graph. Besides, I emphasized the bar for "US black" (in red) over the bars for other countries and ethnicities (in gray), which can help the audience quickly grasp the key information.


### Section 3: Disproportionately High MMR among Black Women in the U.S.

**Visualization:**

- I replaced the original bar chart with a line chart, utilizing different colored lines to represent the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of each racial group. This adjustment aims to visually depict the increasing trend of Black women's MMR over time, making the higher MMR of Black women more noticeable and significant.
  
- Second bar chart: I have added labels and explanations to visually display the MMR ratios of Black and White women at different levels of education (lowest and highest). This helps to more intuitively demonstrate that as educational background improves, racial inequality widens. This will help to show that the issue is systemic and not easily addressed through educational interventions.  In addition to the legend on the right, I have included an x-axis representing different racial groups to help readers easily identify the colors.

### Section 4: Why Do Black Mothers Die?

**Visualization:**

I enhanced the visibility of the labels to ensure they are easily discernible at a glance.


### Section 5: Can those causes be treated or prevented?

**Narrative:**

- I have clearly outlined the preventive measures and treatments for the main causes, along with the extent to which they can be treated for some of the causes supported by data. 
- Additionally, I have included a scroll section that highlights the main causes and their preventability for quick comprehension during presentations, enabling the audience to easily grasp how these causes can be prevented at a glance.


### New Section - Section 6: However

After demonstrating the potential impact of reducing mortality rates, I included a video showcasing real-life examples and personal accounts from Black mothers who have encountered obstacles in accessing healthcare or bias within the medical system. These firsthand stories offer a more compelling and relatable depiction of the challenges at hand, emphasizing the urgency for initiatives to address the scarcity of medical resources. This also sets the stage for the next part.

### Section 7: Call for Action

**Narrative:**

To enhance the section, I divided it into two focused segments. The first part targets policymakers, urging them to craft specific policies addressing preventable pregnancy-related diseases, drawing from data insights. They should review and possibly extend the scope of current policies to broaden their impact. The second segment appeals to college students in public policy, encouraging them to bolster advocacy efforts through volunteering and donations to nonprofits.

**Another Change:**
I have replaced four of five Tableau graphs' embedded code with JPG images. Although it reduces the interactivity of the graph, I ensured that the images provide all the necessary information for the audience. This change has the benefit of preventing the graphs from being squeezed and eliminates the need for the audience to scroll up, down, left, and right to view the entire content. This also allows me to add labels and notes to the original graph, essentially enhancing it with additional information.


## The Audience

For my final data story, I identified two primary audiences: **public health officials and policymakers who have the authority to implement changes, and data scientists along with public health students who are instrumental in analyzing and interpreting health data to support evidence-based policymaking**. This distinction helped tailor the content, making it both informative for those in the field of data analysis and actionable for those in positions to effect change.

In determining the focus of my project, insights from interviews with public health officials, community healthcare coordinators, and individuals affected by maternal mortality provided a nuanced understanding of the challenges and barriers faced by Black mothers. These conversations revealed a critical need for clear, accessible information that not only presents data but also contextualizes it within the broader social determinants of health. Personas developed from these interviews, representing a range of stakeholders from a policy advisor to a public health student, further refined the project's direction, ensuring the content was relevant and engaging for each audience segment.

Specific adjustments made to cater to these audiences included the simplification of complex data visualizations and the inclusion of narrative elements that humanize the data, making the issue more relatable and urgent. For example, the decision to use a line chart to depict the increasing trend of maternal mortality among Black women in section 3 was aimed at making the data more accessible to public health students and officials, highlighting the severity of the issue over time. Additionally, the inclusion of a video in the new section featuring personal accounts from Black mothers was intended to provide a powerful, emotive element to the data story, encouraging policymakers to prioritize maternal health in their agendas.

Also, the adjustment in the "Call for Action" section to explicitly address both policymakers and public health students reflects the project's dual focus on inspiring policy changes and fostering a new generation of advocates. This bifurcated approach aims to ensure that the content is not only informative but also mobilizes action across different sectors of the public health community.

## Final thoughts-Some Takeaway 

During the development process, a series of design decisions were made to enhance the effectiveness of the data story for the target audience. One of the key learnings was the importance of visualization in conveying complex data in an accessible manner. By comparing different visualization formats, it became evident that certain types, such as line charts for trend analysis and bar charts with clear labeling for direct comparisons, were more effective in highlighting the critical issues of MMR disparities. This realization underscored the significance of selecting the appropriate visualization technique to communicate specific data points clearly and compellingly.

Another critical learning was the impact of narrative structure on audience engagement and comprehension. The data story was structured to build a logical flow, starting with a clear definition of MMR and progressively delving into the specifics of the U.S. context, disparities among Black women, and the systemic issues contributing to these disparities. This approach ensured that the audience could easily follow the argument being made and appreciate the urgency and importance of the issue.

Additionally, incorporating real-life stories and accounts from Black mothers provided a human element to the data story, making the statistics more relatable and compelling. This design decision highlighted the real-world impact of the data being presented, fostering a deeper understanding and empathy among the audience.

Lastly, I am sincerely sorry that I couldn't participate in the presentation due to a sudden acute gastrointestinal illness. As a result, I missed the opportunity to directly observe the audience's immediate reaction to my story and make timely adjustments based on their feedback.
