# Maternal Mortality in the US: Understanding the Trends, Tackling the Causes

# Outline

## Summary

The final project aims to illuminate the concerning issue of maternal mortality in the United States, a critical public health matter that has seen fluctuating trends over the years. Through comprehensive data visualization, the project intends to dissect and present the progression of maternal mortality rates over time, shedding light on how these rates have evolved and the underlying factors contributing to these changes. By delving into various dimensions such as age, race, education level, and causes of death, the project seeks to provide a multidimensional analysis of the factors influencing maternal mortality.

Central to the project is the exploration of the disparities in maternal mortality rates among different demographic groups, highlighting how factors such as race, income and education level play a pivotal role in maternal health outcomes. The visualization will not only portray the statistical data but also aim to tell the story behind the numbers, offering insights into the societal and healthcare-related challenges faced by women in the United States. Additionally, the project will critically analyze the causes of maternal deaths, identifying which of these could be preventable with adequate healthcare interventions and policy changes. By doing so, the project aspires to contribute to the ongoing dialogue on improving maternal health care and reducing mortality rates, ultimately pointing towards solutions that could mitigate these deaths in the future.

This comprehensive approach aims not just to present data but to foster a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding maternal mortality in the US. The project's ultimate goal is to drive awareness, inform policy discussions, and spur action toward enhancing maternal healthcare systems to safeguard the lives of mothers across the nation.

# The Data

To effectively analyze and visualize the trends, disparities, and preventable aspects of maternal mortality in the United States, our project will utilize a combination of primary and secondary data sources. The primary data source will be the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), specifically the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The CDC provides comprehensive datasets on maternal mortality rates, causes of death, and other critical health statistics. These datasets include detailed demographic information, allowing for an in-depth analysis of maternal mortality trends over time, as well as by age, race, and education level.

Secondary data sources will include peer-reviewed journal articles and reports from reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and other entities focused on women's health and public health policy. These sources will offer insights into the broader context of maternal health, including factors contributing to disparities and potential interventions that have proven effective in reducing maternal mortality rates.

The utilization of these data sources in our project is multifaceted. Initially, the data will be used to establish a baseline understanding of the maternal mortality landscape in the US, highlighting trends over time and disparities across different demographic groups. This foundational analysis will enable us to identify specific areas of concern, such as age groups, racial and ethnic communities, and socioeconomic statuses that are disproportionately affected by maternal mortality. Following this, we will delve deeper into the causes of maternal deaths, distinguishing between preventable and non-preventable factors. This distinction is crucial for identifying intervention points where healthcare services, policy changes, and community support can make a tangible difference in reducing maternal mortality rates.
