# ðŸŒŸ Jiaxin's Portfolio ðŸŒŸ
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! It's where I'll be showcasing all my awesome work. I hope you enjoy it!

# About me
Hi! I'm Jiaxin Hou, but you can call me Jasmine, and I use she/her pronouns. Hailing from the vibrant landscapes of Northern China, my academic adventure began at Shanghai University, where I dived into the world of accounting. My journey then took an exciting turn to the prestigious Carnegie Mellon University. Here, as a second-year student in the MSPPM (Master of Science in Public Policy and Management) program, I'm not just studying; I'm thriving!

My educational odyssey has been a tapestry of data-related courses, where I've danced with numbers and trends. I've become friends with Python, R, SQL, and Tableau, exploring their intricate worlds. But that's not all! The realm of AI has caught my fancy too, especially the enigmatic areas of Machine Learning (ML) and the awe-inspiring Generative AI.

What do I love? It's the thrill of unraveling complex puzzles with the golden key of data. My arsenal includes sharp analytical skills, a solid grounding in accounting, and a researcher's keen eye. Let's embark on this exhilarating journey of discovery together! ðŸš€

# What I hope to learn
 
1. Crafting Informative and Engaging Stories Supported by Data
2. Enhancing Data Visualization for Clarity and Simplicity
3. Exploring the Intersection of Arts/Design and Technology

**Or something more specific** 
- Critiques and methodologies for data visualization
- Interactive hands-on practice and valuable feedback for enhancing data visualization skills
